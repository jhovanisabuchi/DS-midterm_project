# Data Science Midterm Project

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict housing prices based on various features of the house. By leveraging deep learning, random forest, and decision tree models, the project aims to:

* Accurately estimate house prices based on key attributes such as number of baths, stories, lot size, garage size, and location.
* Compare different machine learning models to determine the most effective approach for price prediction.
* Handle missing data, perform feature selection, and optimize model performance.
* Provide insights into the most influential factors affecting house prices.
* Develop a robust predictive system that can assist buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decision
